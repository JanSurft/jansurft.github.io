excerpt: An introduction to my OpenBSD server setup.

Hello, I'm Jan - welcome to my blog and the first post. Today I managed to finish the rough infrastructure of my OpenBSD Server. I'm not sure how secure it is to expose the whole setup to the world (for intruders its naturally a good start if they exactly know how the server is built and where it might be possible to attack).

But anyway I decided to view this more as a learning experience. If there is somebody who can easily attack the infrastructure after exposing its internal setup then I obviously did not learn enough on the way.

Here is a quick sketch of the server infrastructure I came up with right now:
