Hello, my name is Jan. I'm a computer science student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany.

In addition I'm currently  working as a student research assistant at the Fraunhofer IOSB in the departement **Secure Networked Systems**.

I have a lot of fun programming, building and testing new stuff. In my leisure time I love to go surfing and travelling. But I also really like returning to the desk, working on new projects and getting to know new technologies and people that are involved in them.
