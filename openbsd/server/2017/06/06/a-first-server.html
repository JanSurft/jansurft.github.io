  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Hello, last time I showed a sketch of my server infrastructure without explaining anything really. That's where I'm going to start in this post. As a reminder I will include the picture again:</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>
<i>Figure 1: Server Infrastructure</i>
</figcaption>
<img src="https://blog.hermes-technology.de/assets/server-sketch.svg.png" title="Figure 1: Server Infrastructure" alt="Server Infrastructure" />
</figure>
<p>At first I would like to give a quick overview of what I wanted to achieve with this infrastructure: I wanted to encapsulate as much as possible in virtual machines, that will care about the specific tasks my server should provide in the end. Right now I have a dedicated VM for this blog I'm writing, a cloud, a gitlab server and the host VM which cares about redirecting the different subdomain requests.</p>
<p>But for an easy explanation I will try to start much simpler - actually I will start the same way that I did a few weeks ago. I will just have my OpenBSD server that shows a simple &quot;Hello world!&quot; html page. Starting with this simple setup I will develope the above infrastructure in small steps during the next posts.</p>
<p>For better understanding and visualization I will always backup the explanations with some figures. Throughout those figures I will try to use the format as shown in <em>Figure 2</em> when necessary.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="the-task-for-today">The task for today</h2>
<p>As I already mentioned, today I will only create a simple http server on OpenBSD which is actually a very straight forward task. <em>Figure 3</em> shows the different components that are needed to achieve the desired functionality:</p>
<p>At first I need to install OpenBSD somewhere and connect its NIC (Network Interface Card) to my router. For this first step I could also have installed it in a VM with virtualbox for example.</p>
<p>Thereafter I need to enable port-forwarding and assign a static ip to the server in the router's interface (I had to open the browser and go to 192.168.1.1 for the router's webinterface).</p>
<p>To always be sure to get the same static ip address from my router I will also configure the interface to use a static ip instead of dhcp.</p>
<p>After enabling and configuring the httpd server I will be able to reach the webserver from anywhere in the www, provided that I know my public ip. So the last step would be to make the public ip reachable through a domain name.</p>

<h2 id="openbsd-server---install-and-set-up">OpenBSD server - Install and set up</h2>
<p>As you heard I want to build the whole server-setup using OpenBSD. This was my OS of choice, because it has a strong focus on security. So coming from the Linux world I had to learn a little bit about the workings of a BSD system, and just to anticipate it: I was positively surprised about the celarliness and easyness I had to deal with.</p>
<p>Installing OpenBSD is easy and fast. I just had to follow the instructions at <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html">their homepage</a> and everything was set up well. After installing make sure that your system is connected to your LAN.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>After installing I also setup the <code>sudo</code> equivalent of OpenBSD called <code>doas</code>. For it to work just create a file called <code>/etc/doas.conf</code> and insert these lines:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">permit</span> persist :wheel <span class="co">## permit all users from group wheel to gran root access via doas and let it pe persistent during the terminal session</span>
<span class="ex">permit</span> nopass keepenv root</code></pre></div>
<p>If you have problems setting up a working package mirror for OpenBSD, I found the easiest and always working method of creating a specific file in the <code>/etc/</code> directory, and filling it with my chosen mirror:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">doas</span> touch /etc/installurl
<span class="ex">doas</span> echo <span class="st">&quot;https://ftp.eu.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/&quot;</span> <span class="op">&gt;</span> /etc/installurl</code></pre></div>
<p>Naturally you can choose any OpenBSD mirror you like. There is a list of possible mirrors located <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="some-nice-configurations">Some nice configurations</h3>
<p>I also added some nice configuration for better working with the system:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /etc/doas.conf</span>
<span class="ex">permit</span> persist setenv { -ENV PS1=<span class="va">$DOAS_PS1</span> SSH_AUTH_SOCK } :<span class="ex">wheel</span>
<span class="ex">permit</span> nopass keepenv root</code></pre></div>
<p>Adding these lines to your user's and your root's <code>.profile</code> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /root/.profile</span>
<span class="va">PS1=</span><span class="st">&quot;[\t - \d]\n\u@\H:\w[\s]# &quot;</span>
<span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">PS1</span>
<span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">HISTFILE=</span>~/.sh_history</code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /home/user/.profile</span>
<span class="va">PS1=</span><span class="st">&quot;[\t - \d]\n\u@\H:\w[\s]\n$ &quot;</span>
<span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">PS1</span>
<span class="va">DOAS_PS1=</span><span class="st">&quot;[\t - \d]\n\u@\H:\w[\s]\n# &quot;</span>
<span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">DOAS_PS1</span>
<span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">HISTFILE=</span>~/.sh_history</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>export HISTFILE...</code>: makes the history persistent so its not lost after each session.</li>
<li>PS1: the terminal prompt</li>
<li>DOAS_PS1: the terminal prompt when executing doas</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuring-the-nic-static-ip">Configuring the NIC (static ip)</h3>
<p>For proper functionality its easier to configure the OpenBSD server to obtain a static ip instead of relying on the router's dhcp service. To achieve this, I had to change two files: <code>/etc/hostname.em0</code> and <code>/etc/mygate</code>. The name of your interface could be different which would also result in another filename <code>/etc/hostname.your-interface-name</code>. In a OpenBSD VM the interfaces are called vio0 for example. Resulting in the filename to be <code>hostname.vio0</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /etc/hostname.em0 ##</span>
<span class="ex">inet</span> static 192.168.1.250 255.255.255.0 <span class="co"># this will enable the static ip address 192.168.1.250 with a 255.255.255.0 netmask</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After configuring the static ip I had to make sure that there is a file called <code>/etc/mygate</code> which wasn't present because I installed my OpenBSD Box with dhcp enabled on my NIC. I created the file as root and wrote my routers ip as the single line in the file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /etc/mygate ## </span>
<span class="ex">192.168.1.1</span> <span class="co"># one line that specifies the gateway (in my case 192.168.1.1)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="router-configuration">Router configuration</h2>
<p>As every router and brand has its own way of configuration, I cannot tell you much about how you will be able to achieve this task. So I will roughly tell you how I did it (I am ommiting the router name and brand, as it would expose potential vulnerabilities that it could have that I don't know of). For all configurations I had to open the web interface of my router at 192.168.1.1 and enter my password.</p>
<h3 id="static-ip">Static IP</h3>
<p>For the static ip I had to browse to a category called <em>LAN</em> where I could assign static IP addresses to specific link layer adresses (MACs). So supposed that your NIC has the MAC 12:34:56:78:9A:BC you would tell your router to assign the desired static ip to that MAC. In my case I assigned the ip 192.168.1.250.</p>
<h3 id="port-forwarding">Port-forwarding</h3>
<p>Port-forwarding at my routers interface could be found at Homenet -&gt; Port Forwarding. At this section I could create Port-forwarding rules for IPv4 and IPv6. I only created a rule for IPv4. I had to choose a service name: HTTP, the computer to forward the port to: 192.168.1.250, the transport protokoll: TCP and the Port range: 80-80.</p>
<p><em>Attention</em>: When I created the rule I also had to enable a checkbox to activate that rule. Apart from the rules checkbox I also had to enable Port-forwarding as a whole in another dedicated checkbox on that site. This did cost me a little headache in the beginning because I didn't see the specific rules checkbox when creating the port-forwarding rule and I wondered why the port-forwarding didn't work.</p>
<h2 id="domainname-and-ddns">Domainname and DDNS</h2>
<p>In this section I will explain how I bought a domain name and enabled a DDNS client to update my ip changes to that domain name.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-domain">Getting a domain</h3>
<p>There are a lot of domain registration services that you could use. But not all of them have a dynamic dns service included. I chose <a href="https://www.strato.de">Strato</a> which is a german hosting service. I bought the domain-name hermes-technology.de.</p>
<p>You could also first try things out with a free service like <a href="https://www.noip.com/">noip</a>.</p>
<h3 id="integrating-the-domain-in-the-server">Integrating the domain in the server</h3>
<p>For proper configuration of the server and name resolving I configured my OpenBSD system to use the new domain name as the hostname.</p>
<p>For this to work properly, I had to edit the following files (the explanation for the configuration is commented inline):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /etc/myname ##</span>
<span class="ex">hermes-technology.de</span> <span class="co"># one line that specifies the symbolic name of the host machine </span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /etc/resolv.conf ##</span>
<span class="ex">nameserver</span> 192.168.1.1 <span class="co"># the nameserver the resolver should query</span>
<span class="ex">lookup</span> file bind <span class="co"># gethostbyname and gehostbyaddr should lookup in /etc/hosts first (file) and then ask the provided nameserver (bind)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /etc/hosts ##</span>
<span class="co"># The first two lines are the defaults, the last line again specifies my domain name with my static ip address</span>
<span class="co"># These names will be used by the resolver that is configured to lookup in this file via /etc/resolv.conf</span>
<span class="ex">127.0.0.1</span>   localhost
::<span class="ex">1</span>     localhost
<span class="ex">192.168.1.250</span>  hermes-technology.de</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="making-the-public-ip-reachable-from-the-internet-ddns">Making the public ip reachable from the internet (DDNS)</h4>
<p>My IPS, like most of the private Internet connections, frequently changes my public ip so I cannot assing a static ip to my domain name. A service to circumvent this problem is a so called dynamic DNS client, or short DDNS client on the server side. There are <strong>two possibilites</strong> for this to work: Either my <strong>router itself has a DDNS client</strong> that can resolve the host that I have bought my domainname from, or I will <strong>install a dedicated DDNS client</strong> on my OpenBSD server.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, I bought my domain at the german service called Strato (www.strato.de). At this time my router had a few DDNS hosts that it could make a ddns update for, but Strato was not one of them. So I was left with the second choice: Installing a DDNS client on the OpenBSD server and configuring it to forward ip changes to the strato service.</p>
<p>I decided to install the ddns client called ddclient which is already available in the official ports of OpenBSD. So it was as easy as calling <code>pkg_add ddclient</code> for installing it. Thereafter I was left with the configuration file in /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf. I appended some lines at the bottom of the <code>ddclient.conf</code> file, so that it would look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf</span>

<span class="co">## These lines were enabled by default</span>
<span class="va">daemon=</span>600              # <span class="ex">check</span> every 300 seconds
<span class="va">syslog=</span>yes              # <span class="ex">log</span> update msgs to syslog
<span class="va">mail=</span>root               # <span class="ex">mail</span> all msgs to root
<span class="ex">mail-failure</span>=root           # mail failed update msgs to root
<span class="va">pid=</span>/var/run/ddclient/ddclient.pid  # <span class="ex">record</span> PID in file.
<span class="va">ssl=</span>yes                 # <span class="ex">use</span> ssl-support.  Works with
                    <span class="co"># ssl-library</span>

<span class="co">## ... There were some commented lines in between</span>

<span class="co"># This is the chunk I appended:</span>
<span class="va">use=</span>web
<span class="va">protocol=</span>dyndns2
<span class="va">server=</span>dyndns.strato.com
<span class="va">login=</span>hermes-technology.de
<span class="va">password=</span>somepassword
<span class="ex">hermes-technology.de</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The configuration above has a few components: - The first <code>use=web</code> means, that the ddns server is reached through the internet. - <code>protocol=dyndns2</code> specifies the ddns protocol that the destination server uses. - <code>login=hermes-technology.de</code> is my login name for he server as provided by strato - <code>password=somepassword</code> is the specific password for the ddns service - the last lines of the configuration specifies the domain names that should receive the DDNS updates I only update my main domain for DDNS as I have simple CNAME entries for all other subdomains that are thus reached through the same ip address as the main domain.</p>
<p>I also enabled the ddclient Daemon in the service manager:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">doas</span> rcctl enable ddclient</code></pre></div>
<p>and started it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">doas</span> rcctl start ddclient</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="start-httpd-and-show-your-website">Start httpd and show your website</h2>
<p>At last I wanted to show a simple static html &quot;Hello World!&quot; page on my domain. For this to work I had to configure the <code>httpd</code> daemon, which is a simple http server from OpenBSD based on Apache.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## /etc/httpd.conf</span>
<span class="va">ext_if=</span><span class="st">&quot;*&quot;</span> <span class="co">## any interface is the external interface.. including my em0</span>

<span class="ex">server</span> <span class="st">&quot;hermes-technology.de&quot;</span> {
        
        <span class="ex">listen</span> on <span class="va">$ext_if</span> port 80 <span class="co">## listen on all interfaces on port 80</span>
        
        <span class="ex">root</span> <span class="st">&quot;/htdocs/hermes-technology.de&quot;</span> <span class="co">## make /var/www/htdocs/hermes-technology.de my root website directory</span>
}

<span class="ex">types</span> {
        <span class="ex">include</span> <span class="st">&quot;/usr/share/misc/mime.types&quot;</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<p>After configurin the daemon I had to insert a <code>index.html</code> in my website's directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="bu">cd</span> /var/www/htdocs/hermes-technology.de/</code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">touch</span> index.html</code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span> <span class="op">&gt;</span> index.html</code></pre></div>
